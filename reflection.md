# Reflection

Through this project, I have realised that using OOP has very limited use for simple objects like what I am using. I feel like it is only actually useful when the objects are very complex and have properties that reference each other (for example, in a segment tree). It is also difficult to save to a file and has to be converted to a JSON which was very time consuming :(

I am proud of actually finishing this project, because progress was slow and I felt very demotivated. Even though there was very little (but important) use of user-defined classes in the project, I used JS objects a lot which is related to OOP? I guess? I also learnt a new programming language and a new library which took a lot of time and I am still unsure if it was worth it, hopefully it was :D

I faced many challenges such as not understanding how to use the google drive api and hence scrapping that idea, leading to less time for me to complete the project. In the end, I simply rushed the rest of the work and it somehow worked, so I am quite satisfied :)
