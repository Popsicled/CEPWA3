# General description of project
> Building a general-use Discord bot for my CCA (RISAC)

# Goals of project
> - Allow members to view past resources in an efficient manner
> - Take attendance more efficiently

# Listing of features
> MVP
> - Collect members' information and link to their Discord accounts
> - Categorise members according to their role in the CCA (current member, alumni, EXCO) and allow different commands to be run from that.
> - Update pizza points (gained from helping the club, rewarded with pizza slices)
> 
> Extra
> - Take attendance
# External Scanning
> Since this is something that is so specific, there are no apps that currently exist that does exactly what this app will do, but there are some similar apps.
> 
> - [Dyno](https://dyno.gg) is an app that can run automated tasks, though it is limited in customisation.

# Listing of Key Use Cases
> - Members may need to look at past resources
> - EXCO needs to know who to receive extra pizza slices (if any)

# Skills that my project requires me to pick up
> - A new programming language (node.js)
> - The discord.js library in nodejs
