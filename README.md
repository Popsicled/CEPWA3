# Building a discord bot :O


## Quick guide
### [Source code](src/)
- [Main file](src/bot.js) - "brain" of the bot, contains code that runs code in secondary files
- [Command deployment](src/deploy-commands.js) - registers discord commands
- [Commands](src/commands) - contains all the files that respond to commands
- [Interactions/events](src/events/) - contains all files that respond to "interactions", or events that the bot can detect
- [Miscellaneous files](src/misc/) - contains randoms files that don't quite belong anywhere
- The rest of the files are simply for remote deployment, they can be ignored
- **Some files have been removed when uploaded to Github as they contain sensitive information. This means that this code will NOT run properly without making changes**
