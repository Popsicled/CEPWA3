# Development Log
> A successful final project is built slowly over many weeks not thrown together at the last minute. To incentivize good project pacing and to let your project mentor stay informed about the status of your work, each week you should add an entry to your log.md file in the development directory.

> Each entry should describe:

> - What goals you had set for the week and whether they were accomplished or not
> - What problems you encountered (if any) that prevented you from meeting your goals
> - What you plan to accomplish or attempt next week

> The development log will be graded for completion, detail, and honesty â€“ not progress. It is much better to truthfully evaluate the work you completed in a week then lie to make the project sound further along then it really is. It is totally acceptable to have an entry that says you tried nothing and accomplished nothing. However if every week starts to say that, both yourself and your project mentor will be able to identify the issue before it becomes impossible to fix.

## Week 5 (26 Jul - 1 Aug)
- Think about what I should do
- will probably finish proposal next week
## Week 6 (2 Aug - 8 Aug)
- Finished proposal and start working on project
## Week 7 (9 Aug - 15 Aug)
- Learnt how to read from json and managed to allow members to view their own info using the object.
- tried to implement oop on a CCA member, still a bit scuffed 
- tried to setup the google drive api to no avail, ended up giving up on this idea and focus on members viewing past resources
- hopefully I will finish the implementation of the JS classes by next week
## Week 8 (16 Aug - 22 Aug)
- wanted to finish implementing JS classes for the club members, but had no time
## Week 9 (23 Aug - 29 Aug)
- finished writing the JS classes to represent members and implement methods such as adding pizza points
- hopefully I can get the resources working by next week
## Week 10 (30 Aug - 5 Sep)
- Allowed EXCO to edit member information
- Allowed the EXCO to make changes to the pizza points of the members
- Write the member information to a file so all changes are saved
- Hopefully I can get the resources system working next week, should be much easier since the updating system is more straightforward (I don't really have a choice since its the last week)
## Sep Holiday (5 Sep - 10 Sep) **Submission date is 10 Sep**
